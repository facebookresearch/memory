## Quick start

The following commands launch a SLURM job that creates an environment for Meta Lingua.
The env creation should take around 5 minutes without counting downloads. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/memory
cd memory

bash setup/create_env.sh
# or if you have access to a SLURM cluster
sbatch setup/create_env.sh
```
Once that is done your can activate the environment 
```bash
conda activate lingua_<date>
```
use the provided script to download and prepare data from huggingface (among `fineweb_edu`, `fineweb_edu_10bt`, or `dclm_baseline_1.0`).
This command will download the `fineweb_edu` and prepare it for training in the `./data` directory, specifying the amount of memory `terashuf` (the tool used to shuffle samples) will be allocated.
```bash
python setup/download_prepare_hf_data.py fineweb_edu <MEMORY> --data_dir ./data --seed 42
```
to download tokenizer (here llama3), use the folowing script:
```bash
python setup/download_tokenizer.py llama3 <SAVE_PATH> --api_key <HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>
```
Now launch a debug job to check if everything works.  **The provided configurations are templates, you need to adapt them for them to work (change `dump_dir`, `data.root_dir`, `data.tokenizer.path`, etc ...)**

```bash
# stool stands for SLURM tool !
python -m lingua.stool script=apps.main.train config=apps/main/configs/pkplus_373m_1024k.yaml nodes=1 partition=<partition>
# if you want to launch locally you can use torchrun
torchrun --nproc-per-node 8 -m apps.main.train config=apps/main/configs/pkplus_373m_1024k.yaml
# or you can also launch on 1 GPU
python -m apps.main.train config=apps/main/configs/pkplus_373m_1024k.yaml
```

## Configuration

See `apps/main/configs/pkplus_373m_1024k.yaml` for an example configuration.

## Launching jobs locally

```bash
torchrun --nproc-per-node 8 -m apps.main.train config=apps/main/configs/pkplus_373m_1024k.yaml
```

### Launching with SLURM

Since we want to do distributed training, we need `train.py` to run N times (with N being the number of GPUs)

The easiest way to do this is through SLURM. And in order to make that simpler, we provide `lingua/stool.py` which is a simple python script that 
1. Saves the provided config to `dump_dir`
2. Copies your current code to `dump_dir` in order to back it up 
3. Creates an sbatch file `submit.slurm` which is then used to launch the job with the provided config. 

It can be used through command line 

```bash
python -m lingua.stool config=apps/main/configs/pk_7b.yaml nodes=1 account=fair_amaia_cw_codegen qos=lowest
```

## Evaluations

Evaluations can run either during training periodically or you directly launch evals on a given checkpoint as follows:

```bash
srun -n 8 python -u -m apps.main.eval config=apps/main/configs/eval.yaml
```

You need to specify the checkpoint and dump dir of the evaluation in that config

Or through `stool` with

```bash
python -m lingua.stool script=apps.main.eval config=apps/main/configs/eval.yaml nodes=1 account=fair_amaia_cw_codegen qos=lowest
```

## Related repositories

This code is mostly copied from [Meta Lingua](https://github.com/facebookresearch/lingua) and the changes relevant to our new memory architecture are mainly located under `lingua/product_key`. The product key implementation was initially based on [XLM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM/tree/main/xlm/model/memory).
